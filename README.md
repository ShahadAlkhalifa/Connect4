# Connect4

In this project, we have created classes Minmax which performs the minimax algorithm, and AlphaBetaPruning which performs the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm for solving the Connect4 Problem. We performed five testing options: random agent against the user, minimax agent against the user, alpha-beta agent against the user, minimax agent against the random agent, and alpha-beta agent against the random agent. According to our experiment, the random agent was easily beaten by the user, the minimax agent, and the alpha-beta agent. We found out that the alpha-beta is the best algorithm to tackle the Connect 4 problem.

This project was created as a requirement in (361CSC) Artificial Intelligence Course.
